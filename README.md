## Resources

- **Design**: The graphic design is from a challange made by [https://devchallenges.io/](https://devchallenges.io/) - their challanges are great for developers who are looking for projects to build. Check out the weather app challange [here](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv).
- **APIs**: The app uses [AccuWeather](https://developer.accuweather.com/)'s APIs as a data source. They've got a great free plan for developers who want to test and showcase their apps. You can check all their plans [here](https://developer.accuweather.com/packages).

## Technologies

- *React*
- *Axios* for API calls
- *CSS*
- *Netlify* for deployment 

## Notes

This is the first single page application I've built and it really helped me get comfortable while working with React. Learning axios was also fun and will surely be useful when working with APIs in the future.
